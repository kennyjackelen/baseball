This package of web services interfaces with mongodb.

To access mongodb from PHP, you need to install the PHP driver for mongodb:
* `apt-get install php5-dev php5-cli php-pear`
* `pecl install mongo`
* Add `extension=mongo.so` to php.ini

This also uses the stats package for PHP.
* `pecl install mongo`
* Add `extension=stats.so` to php.ini
